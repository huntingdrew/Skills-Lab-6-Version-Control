Skills Lab 6: Version Control

Hi! This is our group project lab 6 for our class. It's a Python program that does something pretty cool with your favorite number!

What It Does
You need to tell it your name and your favorite number, and then it gives you back a magic number along with a nice message. It's simple but fun! It contains 2 methods: calculate_magic_number and createmessage. We called and use them in the program and they fits the requirement. 

calculate_magic_number: This function doubles the favorite number, adds three, subtracts the remainder of the favorite number divided by two, and returns the result as the magic number.
createmessage: This function formats a message string that incorporates the user's name, their favorite number, and their calculated magic number

How to Use It
Just run the code in the notebook.
It'll ask for your name, so type that in.
Then, it asks for your favorite number. Put that in too! Remembver to put in an integer!
You get a message with your name, favorite number, and a magic number.

Aozhe Wei  did the part where it asks for your name.
Hangting Zhu did the magic number calculation codes.
Yujie Wen wrote the readme file and made it all look nice and let us work together.
